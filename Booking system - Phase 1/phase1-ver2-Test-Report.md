# Booking System - Phase 1 Version 2 Test Report

## Deployment Issues

During the deployment of the updated Booking System - Phase 1 Version 2, it was noticed that the backend server failed to start correctly.

Error logs inside the container showed:

This caused a crash loop. As a result, connection to `localhost:8000/register` was impossible, and the application could not be properly tested.

## Security Impact

Server crashes indicate a lack of proper error handling and module management. An attacker could exploit this weakness to perform Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

## Recommendation

- Fix the module import paths in the source code (`server.ts` or similar file).
- Ensure proper validation and fallback mechanisms for missing or misconfigured libraries.
- Perform regular code reviews and dependency updates.
